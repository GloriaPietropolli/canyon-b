# CANYON-B 
Implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network in order to estimate open ocean variables and nutrient concentration, starting from the knowledge of variables such as temperature, salinity, oxygen and geolocation data. 
The topology of the Neural Network is the one described in the article *"An Alternative to Static Climatologies: Robust Estimation of Open Ocean CO2 Variables and Nutrient Concentration from T, S, and O2 Data Using Bayesian Neural Network"* (Bitting et al, 2018)
